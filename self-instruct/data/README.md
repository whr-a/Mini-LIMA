The initial_generation_1539.jsonl is the initial generated data through basic steps in self-instruct.

The clk_gen_515.jsonl contains 515 pieces of classification instances,since classification instructions must have input.We need to generate more instances with non-empty input.

The all_generated_instances_1300.jsonl is the final data we used.It contains instances selected from initial_generation_1539.jsonl and clk_gen_515.jsonl.There are 642 instances including empty input.
